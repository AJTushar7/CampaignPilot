# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Angular 15 with TypeScript and Angular CLI
- **UI Library**: PrimeNG 15.4.1 components with PrimeIcons and PrimeFlex
- **Styling**: SCSS with PrimeNG theme integration and custom component styles
- **State Management**: Angular services and component-based state management
- **Routing**: Angular Router for client-side navigation
- **Component Structure**: Modular dashboard components with Angular TypeScript architecture

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Angular development server with hot module replacement
- **Language**: TypeScript with Angular services and dependency injection
- **Data Management**: Component-based data handling with TypeScript interfaces
- **Development Setup**: Angular CLI dev server with live reload
- **Data Storage**: In-component mock data with TypeScript interfaces for future API integration

## Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Comprehensive data models including:
  - User management system
  - Campaign entities with multi-channel support
  - Channel performance tracking
  - BSP provider management
  - Customer engagement metrics
  - Festival/event scheduling
- **Migration Strategy**: Database schema migrations managed through Drizzle Kit

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
The project uses a monorepo approach with shared schemas and types between client and server, enabling type safety across the full stack. This reduces duplication and ensures consistency in data models.

### Angular Component Architecture
The dashboard is built using Angular components for each analytics section (KPI cards, channel performance, heat maps, campaign monitoring, AI suggestions, BSP comparison), following Angular best practices with TypeScript interfaces, component lifecycle hooks, and SCSS styling. Each component manages its own state and data binding.

### Interface-Based Storage
The storage layer uses TypeScript interfaces, making it easy to switch from the current in-memory implementation to a database-backed solution without changing business logic.

### Real-time Design Considerations
The architecture supports real-time updates through query invalidation and refetching, with plans for WebSocket integration for live campaign monitoring.
